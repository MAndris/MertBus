MertBus Transport Protocol Libraries

This set of libraries provides transport layer to communication mechanisms built on top of rs485 physical structure. There are 2 sets of libraries currently. One for arduino and one for .net .

This library **only** provides transport layer. This very first version does not block network collusions so developers (if they want to use this library) should design their protocols according to this. 

Please check the wiki pages for further information.
